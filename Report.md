Sorting.

## 2. _due 10/25_ Brief project description (what algorithms will you be comparing and on what architectures)

For example:
- Algorithm 1a (MPI + CUDA)
- Algorithm 1b (MPI on each core)
- Algorithm 2a (MPI + CUDA)
- Algorithm 2b (MPI on each core)

- Merge Sort (MPI)

  Merge sort is a comparison-based algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach for sorting arrays.
  
  Psuedocode (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort):
  ```
  function merge_sort(list m) is
    // Base case. A list of zero or one elements is sorted, by definition.
    if length of m ≤ 1 then
        return m

    // Recursive case. First, divide the list into equal-sized sublists
    // consisting of the first half and second half of the list.
    // This assumes lists start at index 0.
    var left := empty list
    var right := empty list
    for each x with index i in m do
        if i < (length of m)/2 then
            add x to left
        else
            add x to right

    // Recursively sort both sublists.
    left := merge_sort(left)
    right := merge_sort(right)

    // Then merge the now-sorted sublists.
    return merge(left, right)

  function merge(left, right) is
    var result := empty list

    while left is not empty and right is not empty do
        if first(left) ≤ first(right) then
            append first(left) to result
            left := rest(left)
        else
            append first(right) to result
            right := rest(right)

    // Either left or right may have elements left; consume them.
    // (Only one of the following loops will actually be entered.)
    while left is not empty do
        append first(left) to result
        left := rest(left)
    while right is not empty do
        append first(right) to result
        right := rest(right)
    return result
  ```
