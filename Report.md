- Merge Sort (MPI)

  Merge sort is a comparison-based algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach for sorting arrays.
  
  Psuedocode (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort):
  ```
  function merge_sort(list m) is
    // Base case. A list of zero or one elements is sorted, by definition.
    if length of m ≤ 1 then
        return m

    // Recursive case. First, divide the list into equal-sized sublists
    // consisting of the first half and second half of the list.
    // This assumes lists start at index 0.
    var left := empty list
    var right := empty list
    for each x with index i in m do
        if i < (length of m)/2 then
            add x to left
        else
            add x to right

    // Recursively sort both sublists.
    left := merge_sort(left)
    right := merge_sort(right)

    // Then merge the now-sorted sublists.
    return merge(left, right)

  function merge(left, right) is
    var result := empty list

    while left is not empty and right is not empty do
        if first(left) ≤ first(right) then
            append first(left) to result
            left := rest(left)
        else
            append first(right) to result
            right := rest(right)

    // Either left or right may have elements left; consume them.
    // (Only one of the following loops will actually be entered.)
    while left is not empty do
        append first(left) to result
        left := rest(left)
    while right is not empty do
        append first(right) to result
        right := rest(right)
    return result
  ```

- Bubble Sort (MPI)

  Bubble Sort is a sorting algorithm that repeatedly compares adjacent elements in an array, moving forward in the array window until it reaches the end of the array.
  If two elements that are being compared have the second element as larger than the first, then those elements are swapped.
  In its most basic and non- optimized form, it repeats this n - 1 times where n is the size of the array. This sorting algorithm is also known as sinking sort.

  Pseudocode (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort):
  ```
  procedure bubbleSort(A : list of sortable items)
    n := length(A)
    repeat
        swapped := false
        for i := 1 to n-1 inclusive do
            { if this pair is out of order }
            if A[i-1] > A[i] then
                { swap them and remember something changed }
                swap(A[i-1], A[i])
                swapped := true
            end if
        end for
    until not swapped
  end procedure
  ```
